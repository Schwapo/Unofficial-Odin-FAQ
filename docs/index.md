Hey, my name is Antonio Rafael Antunes Miranda a.k.a. Schwapo. I've created this website to answer frequently asked questions from the Odin Inspector [Discord Channel].
I will try to update this repository whenever I feel that a question is getting asked a lot and I have an answer for it.

I'd recommend the following steps in order to find a solution to your problem.

1. Check Odins [Attribute Examples], [Documentation] or [Tutorials].
2. Check this site.
3. Check the official [Discord Channel] and use the search function to see if someone else had the same question and got an answer.
3. Ask for help in the [Discord Channel].
