# Changing The PreviewField Preview

Unfortunately, there is no default way to change the preview that the [PreviewField] attribute shows because Odin just asks Unity for a preview texture and shows whatever it gets. If you really need it you can create a custom attribute yourself that is capable of showing a different preview texture or you can use the attribute I created called [ObjectPreview] which has a lot of features that people asked for in the [Discord Channel].
